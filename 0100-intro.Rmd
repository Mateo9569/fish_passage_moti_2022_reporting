New Graph Environment Ltd. was retained by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in the summer of 2022 to conduct effectivness monitoring at three sites in northern BC. Subject streams included Cross Creek in the  and Weigert Creek. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu to assist with project delivery.

The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat [@Bramblett_2002; @swalesRoleOffChannelPonds1989; @diebel_etal2015EffectsRoad].  Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues [@slaneyFishHabitatRehabilitation1997; @cote_etal2005Fishpassage].

As the costs and effort required for works to remediate  fish passage issues through the replacement of road/stream crossings can be significant, acquisition of detailed habitat, fish sampling, water temperature and discharge data is a prudent measure to help ensure there is a reasonable understanding of current conditions, including species composition/density upstream and downstream of the crossings as well as the value and suitability of associated habitats for target fish species (westslope cutthrout trout) before investments in infrastructure to improve connectivity are made.  This work helps build our understanding of the extent of the issues present that may be a result of subject culverts as well as providing baseline data for assessing the benefits of remedial work post-fish passage remediation.
