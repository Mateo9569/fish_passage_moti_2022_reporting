Mostly cobbles and boulders in stream. Some deep pools with fish found. All bull trout except one which was WCT. Only trace amounts of woody debris. Good flow with abundant boulder cover throughout. Rare pockets of gravels at pool outlets only. High value habitat. 12:12:56

7,Weigert Creek,197534_us4,197534,us4,,2022-09-29,14:32:07,AI,440,medium,,,,,Medium value habitat. Frequent large woody debris jams between 40 and 70 cm in height. Frequent small cascade sections of up to 10% and up to 3 to 5 m long. Numerous sections with ample quantity of gravels suitable for resident and fluvial WCT. Surveyed in a downstream direction with the bottom end of the site at the first ford. 14:32:07

Could block passage of smaller fish. Lots of large woody debris changing the stream course and leading to small cascades. Wide channel with cover from boulders and cobbles. Deep pools in outlet to cascades. Some areas with gravels suitable for spawning. Good amount of cover from overhanging veg. 14:06:36

Some of the flows in the low section may have been influenced by ground water from the main stem. First 2 widths and 1 gradient in high water side channel of main stem. Dewaters until just below culvert in outlet pool. All fish were caught in pool. Gravels present in lowest section of trib where overlaps with side channel. 10:33:46

Multiple LWD jam steps between 0.3-0.6m but no permanent barriers to upstream migration. Pockets of gravels present for resident and fluvial WCT and BT. Deep pools present suitable for overwintering.

Many deep pools suitable for rearing. Some gravels suitable for spawning. A couple of high cascades and LWD jams that could be barrier to smaller fish. Good riparian veg but not a lot of overhanging cover. 13:17"
