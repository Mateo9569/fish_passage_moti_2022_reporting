1,Bittner Creek,196200_ds,196200,ds,,2022-08-27,,,100,medium,,,,Effectiveness monitoring site. Abundant gravels immediately downstream of the bridge as well as approximately 30 m upstream. Numerous parr and sculpin observed upstream and downstream other bridge.
2,Bittner Creek,196200_us,196200,us,,2022-08-27,,,130,medium,,,,Effectiveness monitoring site. Adjacent landowner reports stream dewaters annually.  Decent amount of water present at time of survey with numerous salmonid parr observed that appeared to likely be chinook salmon.
3,Cross Creek,198283_ds,198283,ds,,2022-08-28,,,100,high,,,,Effectiveness monitoring site. High value habitat for sockeye and koanee spawning.  Numerous spawning sockeye present.  Surveyed from 100m downstream of newly installed open bottomed culvert.
4,Cross Creek,198283_x,198283,x,,2022-08-28,,,,,,,,Effectiveness monitoring site. Site measurements are inside of the newly installed open bottomed culvert.
5,Five Mile Creek,17501664_us,17501664,us,,2022-09-16,,,150,low,,,,Effectiveness monitoring site. Small stream with good flow. Extremely high conductivity and significant amounts of algae within the channel indicates that there are rangeland impacts from cattle upstream. Suspect that there has been significant rainfall in the last day or two as a stream is running at bankfull levels during the survey. Step pool channel morphology with natural boulder line steps of 0.2 to 0.4 cm throughout the area survey. Conditions in the channel within the pipe and immediately upstream and downstream of the pipe are not significantly different than what we see in the channel over the area surveyed upstream. LWD jam (0.7m high) located at approximately 150m upstream of highway.
