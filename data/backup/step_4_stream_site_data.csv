Small stream with good flow. Extremely high conductivity and significant amounts of algae within the channel indicates that there are rangeland impacts from cattle upstream. Suspect that there has been significant rainfall in the last day or two as a stream is running at bankfull levels during the survey. Step pool channel morphology with natural boulder line steps of 0.2 to 0.4 cm throughout the area survey. Conditions in the channel within the pipe and immediately upstream and downstream of the pipe are not significantly different than what we see in the channel over the area surveyed upstream. LWD jam (0.7m high) located at approximately 150m upstream of highway.
