There are yellow slashes under the chin but the mouth does not reach past the eye and we haven’t seen any larger age class fish with the/us. The big fish all appear to be rainbow having a suspect that the small ones may also be remote. Unless they’re hybrids. During the fish processing process it appeared that it is very likely that all of the fish that were classified as cutthroat were actually rainbow.
