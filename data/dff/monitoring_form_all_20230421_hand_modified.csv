Downstream average channel width was 8.2m and upstream was 6.4m.  , Substrate equivalent to upstream and downstream and consists of primarily gravels and small cobbles.         ,Downstream area adjacent to the bridge was lacking meaningful riparian vegetation due to a likely lack of shrub/tree installation during construction and the size of the channel in this location due to historic massive outlet pool.,no, Flow depths are shallow downstream of bridge where large deposit of gravel is located. Wondering if this gravel accumulated over the years when the culvert was in place and potentially restricting flows upstream resulting in deposition of gravels in this area.  Channel restoration plan to restore areas where large outlet pools were located are a good idea., Crossing structure appears stable at this point in time.         , Revegetation appears reasonable. Future opportunities could be explored for riparian restoration on the river right bank where agricultural field is directly adjacent to the creek.          ,There does not appear to be any habitat enhancements creating cover in the vicinity of the bridge.          , No maintenance issues. The wetted channel is extremely small immediately downstream of the bridge where gravels have accumulated. This may be causing connectivity issues during dry times of year however perhaps this is part of typical dewatering in this system.      ,,,,,,,1217945.558,997323.0628,"c(1217945.55806295, 997323.062751104)"

They appear to be growing at this point but year two and three will provide better indicators of survival/cover.          ,yes, Flow depths range from 4 - 7 cm at outlet and similar upstream. If there was a way to create more complexity in the substrate underneath the crossing there could be better holding areas for fish to move through. However that does not appear to be fish stacked up at the outlet and there are numerous spawning fish upstream.          , Crossing structure appears stable at this point in time.         , More riparian plantings could have been placed upstream on the left and right banks as there is notable erosion there. Natural recruitment a cottonwood may provide stability and long-term cover.          , Large woody debris is placed upstream of the crossing however they are small links of wood from half a metre to 3 m long and will not likely remain in the channel. Some boulders were placed upstream which will likely provide habitat complexity in the long term.          , No maintenance issues noted.,,,,,,,1018940.263,1057002.296,"c(1018940.26281969, 1057002.29594932)"
