It is only the top 2 1/2 m of pipe that is not fully embedded with natural substrate. Although this call hurt me the score as a barrier from the Provincial metric conditions within the pipe are very similar to Outlet of the culvert is embedded 80 cm. It is only the top 2 1/2 m of pipe that is not fully embedded with natural substrate. Although this culvert may score as a barrier from the Provincial metric conditions within the pipe are very similar to what we see upstream within the step pool channel.     ,,,,,,
