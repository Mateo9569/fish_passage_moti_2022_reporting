We have the measurements of upstream and downstream averages as well as the measurements of underneath the bridge.          ,,,, Flow Depp’s or shallow downstream ridge where large deposit of gravel is located. Wondering if this gravel is sediments accumulated over the years when the culvert was in place and potentially restricting flows, Stability does not appear to be an issue as this is a new bridge structure          , Revegetation appears reasonable. Wondering if there could’ve been opportunities for riparian restoration on the river right bank where agricultural field is directly adjacent to the creek.          ,          , No maintenance issues. The wedded channel is extremely small down in the bridge where all of the gravel settlements are located. This may be causing connectivity issues.      ,,,,,,,1217945.55806295,997323.062751104,"c(1217945.55806295, 997323.062751104)"

Numerous sockeye holding upstream and downstream of the Crossing. Multiple large dead Spond out sockeye present. Live cuttings appear to be growing however year two and three will be better indicators of success for revegetation.          ,form_monitor_202208271008.gpkg,,2000-02-01,Yes,1,1,1,1,2,1,3,3,5,3,10,8,5,10,6,42,47,newgraph_airvine,20220828_121215.jpg,20220828_121228.jpg,20220828_121232.jpg,20220828_125135.jpg,20220828_125129.jpg,20220828_121219.jpg,20220828_125223.jpg,20220828_125231.jpg,,,,,, Channel is watered all the way through at this point          , Velocity seems similar to downstream upstream although there are not defined Stoneline Riffel breaks yet          , Culvert does not appear to constricted channel at all          , Substrate is equivalent to upstream and downstream and consists of primarily gravels and small          , Cutting were placed in the upstream downstream sides of the gabion basket walls as well as immediately adjacent to the culvert. They appear to be growing at this point but your two and three will be better indicators of survival.          ,yes, Flow depths ange from 4 - 7 cm at outlet and appear similar upstream. If there is someway to get more complexity in the substrate underneath the crossing there could be better holding areas for Fish to move through. However that does not appear to be Fish stacked up at the outlet and there are numerous fish upstream          , Crossing appears stable at this point in time          , More riparian plantings could’ve been placed upstream on the left and right thanks is there is notable erosion there. Natural recruitment a cottonwood may provide stability and long-ter          , Large Woody debris is placed upstream in the crossing however they are small links of wood from half a metre to 3 m long and will not likely remain in the channel. Some folders were placed upstream which provide complexity and will result in a diversity of dabs in the long term likely.          , No maintenance required at this time,,,,,,,1018940.26281969,1057002.29594932,"c(1018940.26281969, 1057002.29594932)"
