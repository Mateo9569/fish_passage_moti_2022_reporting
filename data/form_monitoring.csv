Future opportunities could be explored for riparian restoration on the downstream river right bank where agricultural field is directly adjacent to the creek.	","There does not appear to be any habitat enhancements creating cover in the vicinity of the bridge. Reports related to project planning indicate that the historic outlet pool was meant to provide cover however this area has infilled with gravels.	 ",No maintenance issues. The wetted channel is extremely small immediately downstream of the bridge where gravels have accumulated.
