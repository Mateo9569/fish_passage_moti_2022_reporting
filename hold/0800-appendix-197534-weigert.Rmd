# Weigert Creek - 197534 - Appendix {-}

## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on
Highway 43, approximately 23.5km north of the town of
Sparwood. The culvert is located approximately 1.3km
upstream from the confluence with the Elk River and is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, Weigert Creek is a
`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a
watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from
a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to
`r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table
\@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197534)). Although multiple upstream survey sites are recorded within provincial databases, there have been no fish recorded upstream [@moe2020KnownBC].

<br>

```{r tab-wshd-197534, eval = T}
fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0('Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing ', my_site, '.'),
           footnote_text = 'Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above',
           scroll = F)

```

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was assessed in 2020 by [@irvine2021UpperElk] and ranked as a barrier for upstream fish migration. The site was noted as having a significantly sized outlet drop (1.2m) and good flow with a location very close to the mainstem of Bighorn Creek which contains confirmed spawning habitat for westslope cutthrout trout. There was 0.8km of steep but viable juvenile rearing habitat surveyed upstream of crossing 197844 in 2021. Bighorn Creek has been noted as contributing significantly to habitat suitable for bull trout spawning in the Wigwam River system with spawning been noted just upstream of the confluence with the Wigwam River. The Wigwam River has been characterized as the most important spawning system in the East Kootenay region, supporting some of the largest westslope cutthrout trout in the Kootenay Region and is located ~11.5km downstream of the subject culvert [@strong_k_d_2015McNeilSubstrate; @cope_morris2001WigwamRiver].  A detailed write up of habitat details and stream characteristics can be found in the 2021 report memo linked [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/appendix---197534---weigert-creek.html).

## Temperature
Temperature data was collected at 30 minute intervals between June 24, 2023 and November 2, 2023 from a station located approximately 20m upstream of Highway 43.  Results are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-temp-weigert) and raw data is available [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2022_reporting/tree/main/data).

## Discharge
Discharge was measured upstream and downstream of the crossing on October 18, 2023.  Stations locations and discharge recorded are presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-weigert-discharge). 

```{r tab-weigert-discharge}
my_caption <- 'Discharge recorded at Weigert Creek upstream and downstream of Highway 43.'

hydrometrics %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(gazetted_name, 'Weigert')) %>% 
  select(-gazetted_name, -`dd/mm/yy & time`) %>% 
  mutate(location = str_to_title(location)) %>% 
  purrr::set_names(c('Location', 'Discharge (m3/s)', 'Zone', 'Easting', 'Northing')) %>%

## Stream Characteristics Downstream {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed at two different sites downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (sites shown in Figure \@ref(fig:survey-site-map)). The first site was located at the confluence to the Elk River where Weigert Creek redirects to the south. This section was surveyed for 520m. The stream was very fast flowing in sections. The average channel width was 4.38m, the average wetted width was 3.48m, and the average gradient was 3.1%. There were clumps of large woody debris that added complexity to stream habitat. Total cover was rated as moderate with cobbles dominating the in stream substrate. There were some sections that contained gravels suitable for westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning. Habitat quality was rated as medium. The second site was located at the top of the first site, and was surveyed for 450m. Total cover was rated as moderate. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub dominant. Hydrometric flow data was taken at the bottom of this site, approximately 550m downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.     

<br>

## Stream Characteristics Upstream {.unnumbered}

The stream was surveyed at six different sites upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (sites shown in Figure \@ref(fig:survey-site-map)). Hydrometric flow data was taken at the ford (PSCIS crossing 197727). Total measured flow was 0.016m^3^/s. The bottom of the first site was located immediately upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and was surveyed for 350m. The second site was in reach two and was surveyed for 300m to the ford. This section had a wide channel with fast flow. Many larger fish were caught (>200mm). Some deep pools were present at the time of survey that are suitable for overwintering. The dominant in stream substrate was cobbles, followed by boulders. The third site was located upstream of the ford and was surveyed for 550m. Site four was also in reach two and was surveyed for 350m. This section had good flow with abundant boulders and large woody debris. There were some deep pools and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. The fifth site was in reach four and was surveyed for 330m. The stream was steep at some sections, with measured gradients up to 10.5%. The channel was wide with good flow. There were many deep pools suitable for rearing. Some gravels were present suitable for salmonid spawning. A couple of high cascades and large woody debris jams approximately 1m in height were seen that would be a barrier for the upstream migration of smaller fish. At site six in reach five, the stream was dry so the surveyors worked their way back to where the water began and surveyed 300m upstream. The stream channel was frequently confined and there was abundant cover. Overall, the habitat value upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`  was medium to high for salmonid rearing and spawning. There were locations in each reach with patches of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, and stable debris; all of which are essential for the fish population.
