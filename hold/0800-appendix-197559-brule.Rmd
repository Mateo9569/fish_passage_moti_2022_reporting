# Brule Creek - 197559 - Appendix {-}

## Site Location {.unnumbered}

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on Highway 43 approximately 20km north of the town of Sparwood, 0.7km upstream from the confluence with the Elk River.  This crossing is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. This stream was assessed in 2020 by [@irvine2021UpperElk]. Two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing 197559 respectively. 

<br>

## Background {.unnumbered}

At the highway, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with watershed characteristics detailed in Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197559). Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout and rainbow trout above (MoE 2020b). On the south side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 2000m, is the 5ha Josephine Lake (also known as Big Lake). The lake was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 (MoE 2020b; “Fish Inventories Data Queries” 2020).  PSCIS stream crossings 197533 and 197559 were ranked as high priorities for follow up with new structures designs following habitat confirmations by @irvine2021UpperElk due to the large size of the stream network upstream of the highway. Detailed reporting can be found [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/appendix---197533-197559---brule-creek.html).  In 2020, the channel was noted as dewatered immediately upstream of Highway 43 with intermittent pools only to a distance approximately 670 m upstream.

## Discharge
Discharge was measured upstream and downstream of Highway 43 on October 18, 2023.  Stations locations and discharge recorded are presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-brule-discharge). 

```{r tab-brule-discharge}
my_caption <- 'Discharge recorded at Weigert Creek upstream and downstream of Highway 43.'

hydrometrics %>% 
  filter(stringr::str_detect(gazetted_name, 'Brule')) %>% 
  select(-gazetted_name, -`dd/mm/yy & time`) %>% 
  mutate(location = str_to_title(location)) %>% 
  purrr::set_names(c('Location', 'Discharge (m3/s)', 'Zone', 'Easting', 'Northing')) %>% 
  fpr::fpr_kable()

```

## Stream Characteristics {.unnumbered}

The stream was electrofished at two sites upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-site-map)). The first site was located approximately 1km upstream from the culvert. This section was surveyed for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us_ef1', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. The average channel width was 6.0m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant streambed substrate was cobbles, with gravels sub-dominant. Total cover from overhanging vegetation and large woody debris was abundant. The habitat quality was rated as medium due to the abundance of spawning gravels suitable for resident salmonids. Hydrometric flow data was taken at the bottom of this site with discharge estimated at 0.183m^3^/s. 

<br>

The second site was located approximately 1km upstream of PSCIS crossing 197536. This section was surveyed for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us_ef2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m to the location of a waterfall shown in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197559-04).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197559-u04)."))` This waterfall was approximately 7m in height, and blocks the upstream migration of all fish. This obstacle is listed in the BC Provincial Obstacles to Fish Passage catalogue [@ministryofwaterlandandresourcestewardship2023ProvincialObstacles]. At the time of survey, the average channel width was 7.47m, the average wetted width was 4.90m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub dominant. The habitat quality was considered high. There were abundant gravels suitable for resident and fluvial westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning. Few pools were present that would be suitable for overwintering. Hydrometric flow data was also taken downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`.

## Fish Sampling {.unnumbered}

Electrofishing was conducted at two sites upstream of the highway with no fish captured at either site (Tables \@ref(tab:tab-fish-site-197559) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197559)). Habitat details are summarised in Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197559).
