PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on Highway 43, approximately 23.5km north of the town of
Sparwood approximately 1.3km upstream from the confluence with the Elk River. Elk Valley Park recreation site is located downstream of the crossing adjacent to the right bank of the river and the watershed upstream of the crossing is a habitat protection area with motor vehicle restrictions. The highway culverts are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, Weigert Creek is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197534)). Although multiple upstream survey sites are recorded within provincial databases, before 2022 there were no fish recorded upstream [@moe2020KnownBC].  Although all upstream crossings on the mainstem of Weigert Creek have been assessed as fords, Vast Resource Solutions engineers were present at the site in the fall of 2022 and were conducting the surveys for bridge installation at the crossing located approximately 1.2km upstream of Highway 43.

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was assessed in 2020 by [@irvine2021UpperElk] and ranked as a barrier for upstream fish migration.  A detailed write up of habitat details and stream characteristics can be found in the 2021 report memo linked [here](https://www.newgraphenvironment.com/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/appendix---197534---weigert-creek.html).

### Temperature
Temperature data was collected at 30 minute intervals between June 24, 2023 and November 2, 2023 from a station located approximately 20m upstream of Highway 43 with results are summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:fig-temp-weigert), Table \@ref(tab:temp-weekly) and raw data available [here](https://github.com/NewGraphEnvironment/fish_passage_elk_2022_reporting/tree/main/data). The growing season at the location of the logger in 2023 was determined to be from June 7 to October 16.  A summary of weekly water temperatures in Weigert Creek along with average air temperatures (averaged from hourly values) at Sparwood climate station ID 1157632 are presented in Figure \@ref(tab:temp-weekly).  Average weekly water temperatures were at or above 7$^\circ$C for only four of the 16 week growing season with a total of 693.5 Celsius degree-days calculated from the data for this period.  Some caution should be applied to the interpretation of this data as the first week of water temperature data collected only consisted of three days worth of data (June 24 - June 26) so there is some potential that temperatures in the days and weeks before were high enough that the growing season could be considered longer.

### Stream Characteristics Downstream

Weigert Creek was surveyed at two different sites downstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (sites shown in Figure \@ref(fig:map-weigert)). The first site was located at the confluence to the Elk River where Weigert Creek redirects to the south. This section was surveyed for 520m. The stream was very fast flowing in sections. The average channel width was 4.38m, the average wetted width was 3.48m, and the average gradient was 3.1%. There were clumps of large woody debris that added complexity to stream habitat. Total cover was rated as moderate with cobbles dominating the in stream substrate. There were some sections that contained gravels suitable for westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning. Habitat quality was rated as medium. The second site was located at the top of the first site, and was surveyed for 450m. Total cover was rated as moderate. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub dominant. Hydrometric flow data was taken at the bottom of this site, approximately 550m downstream of the highway (Table \@ref(tab:tab-weigert-discharge)).     

<br>

### Stream Characteristics Upstream 

The stream was surveyed at six different sites upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` (sites shown in Figure \@ref(fig:map-weigert)). The bottom of the first site was located immediately upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` and was surveyed for 350m. The second site was in reach two and was surveyed for 300m to the ford. This section had a wide channel with fast flow. Many larger fish were caught (>200mm). Some deep pools were present at the time of survey that are suitable for overwintering. The dominant in stream substrate was cobbles, followed by boulders. The third site was located upstream of the ford and was surveyed for 550m. Site four was also in reach two and was surveyed for 350m. This section had good flow with abundant boulders and large woody debris. There were some deep pools and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. The fifth site was in reach four and was surveyed for 330m. The stream was steep at some sections, with measured gradients up to 10.5%. The channel was wide with good flow. There were many deep pools suitable for rearing. Some gravels were present suitable for salmonid spawning. A couple of high cascades and large woody debris jams approximately 1m in height were observed that could impede upstream migration of smaller fish. At site six in reach five, the streambed was dewatered. Surveyors worked their way back to where the water ended and surveyed the dry 300m upstream. The stream channel was frequently confined and there was abundant cover. Overall, wetted habitat  upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)`  was ranked as medium to high value for westslope cutthrout trout rearing and spawning with patches of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, and stable debris present.      

<br>

### Fish Sampling 

Electrofishing was conducted at eight sites with results summarised in Tables \@ref(tab:tab-ef-site-weigert) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197534) and Figure \@ref(fig:plot-fish-box-197534). Habitat details are summarized in Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197534). Although westslope cutthrout trout, mountain whitefish, bull trout and brook trout were captured downstream of the Highway, only westslope cutthrout were captured above. Also of note, numerous westslope cuthrout trout were captured downstream and upstream of the crossing with a notable presence of only adult fish upstream of the crossing and also a significant increase in the density of adult fish upstream of the crossing. Interestingly, fish were captured upstream of the highway only within the first two reaches to within 300m upstream of the first ford on the Weigert Creek FSR that is located at an elevation of 1320m approximately 1.5km above Highway 43. Above this location, although significant electrofishing effort was conducted (at a location approximately 3km upstream of the highway within Reach 3 and at a site located approximately 6km upstream of the highway within Reach 4), no fish were captured.

PSCIS crossings `r as.character(my_site2)` and `r as.character(my_site)` are located on Brule Creek approximately 20km north of the town of Sparwood.  Crossing `r as.character(my_site2)` is located on Busato Road 600m upstream from the confluence with the Elk River and crossing `r as.character(my_site)` is located on Highway 43 approximately 725m upstream from the confluence with the Elk River.  Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Both crossings as well as habitat upstream and downstream was assessed in 2020 by @irvine2021UpperElk with detailed reporting linked [here](https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/). Two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing 197559 respectively. 

<br>


At the highway, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with watershed characteristics detailed in Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-197559). Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout and rainbow trout above (MoE 2020b). On the south side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 2000m, is the 5ha Josephine Lake (also known as Big Lake). The lake was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 (MoE 2020b; “Fish Inventories Data Queries” 2020).  PSCIS stream crossings 197533 and 197559 were ranked as high priorities for follow up with new structures designs following habitat confirmations by @irvine2021UpperElk due to the large size of the stream network upstream of the highway. In 2020, the channel was noted as dewatered immediately upstream of Highway 43 with intermittent pools only to a distance approximately 670 m upstream. Assessments in 2022 demonstrated that the culvert on Busato Road was in extremely poor condition with deformations of the inlet and extensive corrosion. Both the Busato Road and Highway 43 culverts are extremely undersized which is evidenced by the severe down cutting below their outlets, the large outlet drops (>1m) and the dee/wide outlet pools.  A map of the watershed is provided in attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "elkr", archive_date = "2022-03-17")`).

### Discharge
Discharge was measured upstream and downstream of Highway 43 on October 18, 2023.  Stations locations and discharge recorded are presented in Table \@ref(tab:tab-brule-discharge).

### Stream Characteristics 

Habitat characteristics were gathered at two sites upstream of Highway 43 where electrofishing was conducted in 2022 (Figure \@ref(fig:map-brule) and Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-197559).

<br>

The first site was located approximately 1km upstream from the culvert. This section was surveyed for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us_ef1', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m. The average channel width was 6.0m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant streambed substrate was cobbles, with gravels sub-dominant. Total cover from overhanging vegetation and large woody debris was abundant. The habitat quality was rated as medium with moderate value for bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout and pockets of spawning gravels suitable for resident salmonids.

The second site electrofished on Brule Creek was located approximately 3.2km upstream of Highway 43. This section was surveyed for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'us_ef2', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m to the location of a waterfall shown in `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197559-04).")}else(knitr::asis_output("Figure \\@ref(fig:photo-197559-u04)."))` This waterfall was approximately 7m in height, and blocks upstream migration for all species and life stages potentially present. At the time of survey, the average channel width was 7.5m, the average wetted width was 4.9m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub dominant. The habitat quality was considered moderate with abundant gravels suitable for resident and fluvial westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning but few pools present that would be suitable for overwintering.

Monitoring of the stream immediately upstream of Highway 43 was conducted throughout 2022 to give an indication for the amount of time that dewatering occurs at this location.  In 2022, dewatering was noted within the first approximately 400m from May 5th to October 15th. Upstream of the first 400m the stream was noted as flowing year round.

### Fish Sampling 

The stream was electrofished at two sites upstream of crossing `r as.character(my_site)` in 2022 with no fish captured at either site (Tables \@ref(tab:ef-site-brule) - \@ref(tab:tab-fish-dens-197559)). However, an adult fish (approximately 30cm long) was observed in an isolated pool on August 4, 2022 approximately 350m upstream of the Highway 43 culvert within a pool within and area that was primarily dewatered.
