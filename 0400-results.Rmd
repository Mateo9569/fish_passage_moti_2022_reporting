## Bittner Creek - PSCIS crossing 196200 

```{r  load-data-196200}
my_site <- 196200
```

PSCIS crossing 196200 on Bittner Creek is located on Foreman Road  within the municiple boundaries of the City of Prince George approximately `r round(fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = downstream_route_measure)*0.001, 1)`km
upstream from the confluence with the Fraser River (Figure \@ref(fig:lidar-bittner)). In 2016, just downstream of the subject crossing, the banks of Bittner Creek were armoured to stabilize two areas of erosion. To compensate for the net negative habitat balance of the project, the replacement of the culvert on Bittner Creek was included as a habitat enhancement in the habitat offsetting plan associated with permitting of the work.


<br>


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, Bittner Creek is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-196200)). 

<br>

The subject site is the first stream crossing structure upstream of the Fraser River with numerous modelled and previously assessed stream crossing structures upstream. Upstream of the site approximately 400m there is a crossing modelled (`modelled_crossing_id` 19703286) on the Canadian National railway line.  Although data related to the assessment of this crossing was not provided and has not been uploaded to the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory Summary System (PSCIS), @dwbconsultingservicesltd_2019FishHabitat report that the "CN crossing is considered passable to fish".

### Crossing Characteristics 

Before remediation, the Bittner Creek culvert at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was documented as a 1.9m wide round culvert of 20m in length, having an outlet drop of 0.7m and a culvert slope of 1% [@moe2023PSCISAssessments].  The crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream migration according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment] .  Photos taken in 2014 - before the remediation was completed are included as Figure \@ref(fig:photo-bittner-cv). 

<br>


In 2022, the site was reassessed. As PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was a bridge it ranked as passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-196200)).

### Stream Characteristics 

Habitat characteristics were gathered upstream and downstream of the Foreman Road bridge over Bittner Creek (Figure \@ref(fig:lidar-bittner) and Table \@ref(tab:tab-habitat-summary-196200). Flows at the time of the survey were low with near dewatering throughout sections of stream surveyed both upstream and downstream.  Water temperature was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'temperature_c', loc = 'ds')`$^\circ$C, pH was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'p_h', loc = 'ds')` and conductivity was `r fpr::fpr_my_habitat_info(col_pull = 'conductivity_m_s_cm', loc = 'ds')`uS/cm. The landowner adjacent to the bridge (north-east side) was consulted to let them know that surveyors would be within the stream channel adjacent to their property. They reported that the stream dewatered completely on an annual basis and that they were not aware of use of the stream by Fraser River salmon.

<br>

Downstream of the bridge, the stream was surveyed for `r fpr::fpr_my_priority_info(loc = 'ds', col_pull = 'length_surveyed')`m.

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` on Cross Creek is located on Babine Lake Road, approximately 30km north-east of the town of
Burns Lake (45 minute drive). At the time of reporting, the mapping for the stream was slightly incorrect with the site located approximately 100m to the north of where shown in the BC freshwater atlas and within Babine Lake Marine Provincial Park - Pendleton Bay Site boundaries. The road is the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.

<br>


At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, Cross Creek is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass() %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd()`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max')`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site')`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198283)).

<br>

PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was identified by the Lake Babine Nation, Dustin Snyder (Spruce City Wildlife Association) as a barrier to fish passage blocking sockeye attempting to spawn annually and brought to the attention of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.  The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure worked together with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Canadian Wildlife Federation to plan and implement replacement of the existing culverts with an open bottomed geotextile soil arched reinforced structure designed by Terratech Consulting Ltd in the summer of 2021.  A short video documents the story [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m--Q-WFt0As&list=PLY-KTbpNXtBFU0Sey9vLs8ljL83ZvyXSk&index=1).  

<br>

An impassible 9m falls is located on the mainstem of the stream approximately 1km upstream of Babine Lake Road [@finsconsultingltd_2000Reconnaissance20; @moe2023ProvincialObstacles].  There are no other stream crossings modelled between the road and the falls.  Upstream of the crossing `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp()` have been recorded [@moe2023KnownBC; @norris2023smnorrisbcfishobs].   Habitat modelling outputs are provided in Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-bcfp-198283) and a map of the watershed (see modelled crossing id 500059) is provided in map attachment [`r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(col_pull = dbm_mof_50k_grid)`](`r fpr::fpr_my_mapsheet(wshd = "babl", archive_date = "2022-09-06")`).

### Crossing Characteristics  

Before remediation, the Cross Creek culverts at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` were documented as 1.8m wide ovals culverts of 12.4m in length, having an outlet drop of 0.45m and a culvert slope of 2% [@moe2023PSCISAssessments].  The crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream migration according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment].  Photos taken in 2017 - before the remediation was completed are included as Figure \@ref(fig:photo-cross-cv). 

<br>

In 2022, the site was reassessed. As PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was a newly installed open bottomed structure it ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_reassessments, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198283)). 

<br>



Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft upstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(" presented in Figures \\@ref(fig:ortho-caption-cross) - \\@ref(fig:model-caption-cross).")} else knitr::asis_output("presented [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public/bc05b8efed3f42f28fced92614b08edd) and [here](https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/maps/public_3D/bc05b8efed3f42f28fced92614b08edd).")`

## Five Mile Creek - PSCIS Crossing 198400

```{r  load-data-198400}
my_site <- 198400
```


PSCIS crossing 198400 is located on Five Mile Creek under Highway 97 approximately 11km east of Williams Lake within the San Jose River watershed group.  The structure is located within the boundaries of the Williams Lake 1 First Nation Reservation. The area around Five Mile Creek is home to T’exelcemc people of the T'exelc First Nation. The T'exelc First Nation (also known as the Williams Lake Indian Band) is part of the larger Secwepemc (Shuswap) Nation with traditional territory covering a vast area of central British Columbia. Secwepemctsin is the language of the Secwepem. It contains the cultural, ecological, and historical knowledge connecting the land and the people [@texelcemc2023; @firstpeoplesculturalcouncil2023]. The Five Mile Creek watershed upstream of the Highway encompasses three other First Nations reserve areas including Five Mile 3, James Louis 3A and Carpenter Mountain 15. Replacement of the historic structure (900mm round culvert) in 2016 was necessary to four-laning Highway 97.


<br>

Five Mile Creek flows into Borland Creek approximately 800m downstream of the highway then into the San Jose River a further 2.1km downstream.  The San Jose River in turn empties into Williams Lake approximately 4.5km downstream of the highway.  Although apparently a rare occurrence, due to impacts to Williams Creek which drains Williams Lake, there are reports of sockeye salmon ascending from the Fraser River to Williams Lake and in theory spawning in the San Jose River.  It is thought that these fish are from the Quesnel stock [@williamslaketribune2022].  

<br>

On Five Mile Creek Between the highway and the San Jose River there are two previously unassessed crossings modelled as closed bottom structures. The first (`modelled_crossing_id` 17500597) is modelled as 300m downstream and the second (`modelled_crossing_id` 17500595) is modelled as located approximately 1km downstream.

<br>

At crossing `r as.character(my_site)`, Five Mile Creek is a `r fpr::fpr_my_bcfishpass(site = 17501664, col_filter = modelled_crossing_id) %>% english::ordinal()` order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(site = 999)`km^2^. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_max', site = 999)`m to `r fpr::fpr_my_wshd(col = 'elev_site', site = 999)`m at the crossing (Table \@ref(tab:tab-wshd-198400)). Upstream of the crossing `r fpr::fpr_my_fish_sp(site = 17501664, col_filter = modelled_crossing_id, col_pull = observedspp_dnstr)` have been recorded [@moe2023KnownBC; @norris2023smnorrisbcfishobs]. Numerous lakes and wetlands are located in the Five Mile Creek watershed including Dugan Lake (96ha), Goldpan Lake (41ha) and Cariboo Bill Lake (30ha). Flows at the time of the survey were

### Crossing Characteristics
Although not docuemtnded in the PSCIS database, before remediation, the Five Mile Creek culvert at PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was documented as 0.9m wide, 48 m long round non-embedded culvert with a gradient of 3%.  Although the site was not The crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream migration according to the provincial protocol [@moe2011Fieldassessment].  Photos taken in 2017 - before the remediation was completed are included as Figure \@ref(fig:photo-cross-cv).

In 2022, the site was reassessed. As PSCIS crossing `r as.character(my_site)` was a newly installed open bottomed structure it ranked as a `r fpr::fpr_my_pscis_info(dat = pscis_reassessments, col_pull = barrier_result) %>% stringr::str_to_lower()` to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table \@ref(tab:tab-culvert-198283)).
