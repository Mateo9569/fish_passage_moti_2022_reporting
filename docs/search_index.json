"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction Since 2020, the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) has been working on a watershed connectivity remediation plan for the Elk River watershed that incorporates the provincial Strategic Approach protocol (Fish Passage Assessment, Habitat Confirmation, Design and Remediation), evolution of the bcfishpass analysis tools (Norris [2020] 2023) and local knowledge of the watershed to prioritize barriers and restore connectivity for westslope cutthroat trout and other species in a strategic manner. Nupqu Resource Limited Partnership (Nupqu) was retained by the CWF in the summer of 2022 to conduct fish habitat, fish sampling assessments, temperature monitoring and discharge monitoring at sites related to road-stream crossings within the Elk River watershed group as part of this connectivity restoration planning. Subject streams included Brule Creek and Weigert Creek. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu to assist with project delivery. Assessments conducted in 2022 complement work completed in 2020 (72 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) and 2021 (92 fish passage assessments and 15 habitat confirmation assessments) which can be viewed interactively online at https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2020_reporting_cwf/ (Irvine 2021) and https://newgraphenvironment.github.io/fish_passage_elk_2021_reporting/ (Irvine 2022). The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As the costs and effort required for works to remediate fish passage issues through the replacement of road/stream crossings can be significant, acquisition of detailed habitat, fish sampling, water temperature and discharge data is a prudent measure to help ensure there is a reasonable understanding of current conditions, including species composition/density upstream and downstream of the crossings as well as the value and suitability of associated habitats for target fish species (westslope cutthrout trout) before investments in infrastructure to improve connectivity are made. This work helps build our understanding of the extent of the issues present that may be a result of subject culverts as well as providing baseline data for assessing the benefits of remedial work post-fish passage remediation.

Although portions of the Elk River watershed group flow into the Flathead River, streams included in 2022 fieldwork were within the portion of the Elk River watershed group that flows into the Elk River (Figure 2.1). The Elk River has a mean annual discharge of 26 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Sparwood and 47.3 m3/s at station 08NK016 near Fernie with flow patterns typical of high elevation watersheds on the west side of the Rocky Mountains which receive large amounts of precipitation as snow leading to peak levels of discharge during snowmelt, typically from May to July (Figures 2.2 - 2.4) (Environment and Canada 2020). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/Overview_ELKR.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Overview map of Study Area knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK016.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/pixel.png&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrograph_08NK002.png&quot;) Figure 2.2: Hydrograph for Elk River near Sparwood (Station #08NK016) and near Fernie (Station #08NK002). knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/hydrology_stats_08NK016b.png&quot;) Figure 2.3: Elk River Near Sparwood (Station #08NK016 - Lat 49.86562 Lon -114.86868).

Available daily discharge data from 1970 to 2020. 2.0.1 Ktunaxa Nation The project location is within the traditional territory of the Ktunaxa Nation (“Ktunaxa Nation” 2020) with Elk River components within an area known as Qukin ʔamakʔis, or Raven’s Land (Ministry of Forests 2020). When Europeans settled in the Kootenay Region around 200 hundred years ago, the Indian Reserves were created which lead to the seven Indian Bands: ʔakisq̓nuk- Columbia Lake Band (Windermere, BC); ʔaq̓am- St. Mary’s Band (Cranbrook, BC); ʔakink̓umǂasnuqǂiʔit- Tobacco Plains Band (Grasmere, BC); yaqan nuʔkiy- Lower Kootenay Band (Creston, BC); kyaknuqǂiʔit- Shuswap Band (Invermere, BC); ʔaq̓anqmi- Kootenai Tribe of Idaho (Bonners Ferry, Idaho); k̓upawi¢q̓nuk- Ksanka Band (Elmo, Montana) “Ktunaxa Nation” (2020) report the vision statement of the Ktunaxa as: “Kȼmak̓qa ksukⱡuⱡa·k kuk̓qani ȼ k̓itqakiⱡ haqa ksiʔⱡ ȼxa ʔa·kⱡukqaʔis ksukiⱡq̓ukaʔmi·k kiʔin Ktunaxa naʔs ʔamak̓ʔis.

Subsurface resource exploration and develpment is prohibited in the Flathead River watershed due to legislation enacted in 2011. At the time of reporting there were four active coal mines in the Elk River watershed (Fording River, Greenhills, Line Creek and Elkview), one closed mine (Coal Mountain) as well as multiple exploration projects and proposed new mines [@ministryofenergy2020EastKootenay]. First Nations, stakeholders, proponents and provincial and municipal governments have recognized that the region has been impacted by historic and current coal operations as well as other stresses such as forestry operations, wildfire, residential development, recreational activities and transportation. To assess the historic, current and potential future conditions of valued ecosystem components and to support resource management decisions within the region, the Provincial Cumulative Effects Framework and the Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework (EV-CEMF) have been formed under joint management between the Ktunaxa Nation Council and the B.C. Ministry of Forests. A working group consisting of the Ktunaxa Nation Council, industry, community, organizations, and provincial government ministries has been formed to provide guidance and oversight for EV-CEMF activities. Valued component technical reports for Grizzly Bear, Riparian and westslope cutthroat trout (Davidson et al. 2018), bighorn sheep, and old and mature forest have been drafted, integrated into an overarching Cumulative Effects Assessment and Management Report (Elk Valley Cumulative Effects Management Framework Working Group 2018) and endorsed by the Working Group. These reports describe the historical, current, and future assessment of cumulative effects in the Elk Valley and provide management and mitigation recommendations. Next steps for the framework include the development of an Implementation Plan to identify priority actions and spatial locations to focus management and mitigation of cumulative effects in the valley which may include actions to address aquatic habitat connectivity issues (Ministry of Forests 2020). 2.1 Fisheries Fish species recorded in the upper Elk River watershed group (streams that drain into the Elk River) are detailed in Table 2.1 (MoE 2020a). Bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout are considered of special concern (blue-listed) provincially and westslope cutthrout trout (Pacific populations) are are listed under the Species at Risk Act by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada as a species of special concern (BC Species &amp; Ecosystem Explorer 2020b, 2020a; Schweigert et al. 2017). fiss_species_table &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/fiss_species_table.csv&#39;)) # filter(`Species Code` != &#39;CT&#39;) %&gt;% fiss_species_table %&gt;% filter(`Upper Elk` != &#39;--&#39;) %&gt;% select(-`Upper Elk`, -Flathead) %&gt;% # rename(Elk = `Upper Elk`) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).&#39;) Table 2.1: Fish species recorded in the study area (FISS 2020).

All have habitat requirements during life history stages that include cold clean water and varied forms of cover (undercut banks, pool-riffle habitat and riparian vegetation). Stream-resident fish inhabitat headwater streams above barriers, complete their life cycle within a relatively small range and typically remain relatively small (i.e. &lt;200mm in length). Fluvial fish are migratory subpopulations that migrate between small spawning/rearing tributaries and larger adult rearing rivers. Lengths of fluvial fish generally reach more than 400mm. Finally, adfluvial subpopulations rear in lakes and migrate to spawning/rearing tributaries with lengths often exceeding 500mm (Schweigert et al. 2017). Spawning habitat for resident and fluvial subpopulations are documented as within the tailouts of deep pools at moderate to high-flow events within small, low-gradient streams with cold well-oxygenated water and clean unsilted gravels (Schmetterling 2001). Proximity to large woody debris, boulder or bedrock cover is important for spawning fish while residing in spawning tributaries as high mortality may result when suitable cover is lacking. The dominant substrate used for spawning is gravel (1.8 - 3.3cm diameter) with spawning occurring in late May and June towards the end of the spring freshet with rising water temperatures between 7-11\\(^\\circ\\)C. References within Thorley et al. (2022) indicate that emergence of hatchery reared westslope cutthrout trout occurs after the eggs have accumulated 570 to 600 thermal units (Celsius degree days) which is consistent with estimates by Coleman and Fausch (2007b) of 570 to 600 Celsius degree days for Colorado Cutthroat Trout. Nine of 11 westslope cutthrout trout radio-tagged in the Blackfoot River drainage, Montana by Schmetterling (2001) made movements to tributaries presumable for spawning. While in tributaries, fish movements to spawning sites averaged 12.5km where they stayed within an approximately 100m reach during the spawning period for between 15 and 63 days. Small perennial streams with a diversity of cover are important for juvenile rearing with young-of-year fish inhabiting low energy lateral habitats (i.e. shallow riffle or backwatered areas) with cover available. Larger juveniles move into pools with social dominance behaviors prevalent and based on fish size. Availability of pool habitat is important and limiting for parr which have large territories (Schweigert et al. 2017; Schmetterling 2001). The suitability of overwintering habitat is determined by groundwater influx and the absence of anchor ice with fluvial adults congregating in slow deep pools in the winter. Boulders and other large in-stream structures or off-channel habitat (beaver bonds and sloughs) provide cover for juveniles with adfluvial fish overwintering in lakes (Schweigert et al. 2017; Brown and Mackay 1995; Cope, Schwarz, and Prince 2017). Cold water temperatures have been demonstrated to provide recruitment bottlenecks in early life stages of westslope cutthrout trout with temperature days during the growing season above an average of 5\\(^\\circ\\)C a key determinant in growth and subsequent fry survival during overwintering (Coleman and Fausch 2007a, 2007b). Ranges of Celsius degree-days during the growing season have been correlated to translocation success governed by recruitment and related to growth and subsequent overwintering survival for greenback cutthroat trout (_Oncorhynchus__clarkii__stomias) and Colorado River cutthroat trout (_O.__c._pleuriticus) in north-central Colorado headwater streams. Research detailed in Coleman and Fausch (2007b) indicates that for translocations of greenback cutthroat trout and Colorado River cutthroat trout in north-central Colorado headwater streams - streams that provide 800–900 degree-days probably sustain recruitment in some years, and report that streams with less than 800 degree-days are generally unsuitable for translocations because of the smaller sizes attained by fry before the onset of winter and the associated greater risk of recruitment failure. In a swimming performance study conducted in an open-channel flume Blank et al. (2020) estimated the overall average swim speeds of westlope cutthrout trout (150mm - 290mm in length) at 0.84m/s with a maximum observed swim speed of 3.55m/s. The greatest threats to westslope cutthrout trout have been identified as hybridization with non-native rainbow trout and degradation of the environment due to forestry, hydroelectric development, mining, urbanization and agriculture (Schweigert et al. 2017). Lamson (2020) sampled over 2000 trout in the Upper Kootenay watershed from 2014 to 2019 with results of genotyping indicating consistently high levels of westslope cutthrout trout allele purity (i.e. very low levels of rainbow trout, yellowstone cutthrout trout or coastal cutthrout trout genetic introgression) throughout the Elk River watershed areas upstream of the Elko Dam. Boyer, Muhlfeld, and Allendorf (2008) sampled 31 sites in the upper Flathead River system within the United States (27 sites) and Canada (4 sites). Genetic introgression declined with latitude with no evidence of rainbow trout allelles within any westslope cutthrout trout sampled within the Canadian portion of the upper Flathead River. # load the csv built with R/02_prep_fig/analyze_fish_wct.R wct_elkr_grad &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = paste0(getwd(), &#39;/data/inputs_extracted/02_prep_report/wct_elkr_grad.csv&#39;)) Gradient of streams is an important determinant of habitat suitability for salmonids with lower gradient habitats often providing the most productive environments for both rearing and spawning while high gradient sections typically present upstream migration barriers and less available habitat. A summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations in the Elk River watershed group delineated by average gradient category of associated stream segments where they were captured is provided in Figure 2.5. Of 4003 observations, 93% were within stream segments with average gradients ranging from 0 - 8%. A total of 73% of historic observations were within stream segments with gradients between 0 - 3%, 12% were within stream segments with gradients ranging from 3 - 5% and 8% were within stream segments with gradients between 5 - 8% (MoE 2020a; Norris 2020). ##bar graph plot_wct_elkr_grad &lt;- wct_elkr_grad %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Gradient, y = Percent)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_bw(base_size = 12)+ labs(x = &quot;Stream Gradient&quot;, y = &quot;WCT Occurrences (%)&quot;) + ggdark::dark_theme_bw() plot_wct_elkr_grad Figure 2.5: Summary of historic westslope cutthrout trout observations vs. stream gradient category. "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment 3.3 Stream Discharge 3.4 Water Temperature", " 3 Methods 3.1 Fish Sampling Electrofishing was utilized for fish sampling according to stream inventory standards and procedures found in the Reconnaissance (1:20 000) Fish and Fish Habitat Inventory Manual (Resources Inventory Committee 2001). Individual captured fish were GPS’d, measured for fork length and released. A Fish Data Submission Spreadsheet Template - V 2.0, January 20, 2020 was populated for all sites and will be submitted to the provincial government under scientific fish collection permit CB22-755885. Habitat characteristics measured included water temperature, pH, conductivity, channel/wetted widths, pool depths, gradient, bankfull channel depth, stage, cover, large woody debris presence/abundance, channel bank characteristics, riparian vegetation type/structural stage, substrate and channel morphology. Downstream and upstream photographs were taken at each site and relevant features were recorded. Habitat data associated with electrofishing sites was collated on “Site Cards” with habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.2 Fish Habitat Assessment The Fish Habitat Assessment Procedures were developed by Johnston and Slaney (1996) to provide a standard framework for identifying needs and opportunities for fish habitat restoration. Field assessments in 2022 included Level 1 assessments - which are standardized protocols for characterizing average fish habitat conditions within stream reaches with the intent to identify scenarios that may limit fish production. Sample sites were divided into distinct geomorphic habitat units based on gradient, water flow characteristics, depth and size/position of the habitat unit relative to the main channel (habitat unit category). Habitat unit categories consisted of primary (occupy more than 50% of the wetted width of the main channel), secondary (side channels) and tertiary units (less than . These habitat units consisted of pools, glides, riffles and cascades which are described in more detail below: Pools - areas of slower, deeper water created by impoundment of water or scour (often associated with large woody debris) with a concave bottom profile and a water surface gradient near 0%. Minimum dimensions for the size of pools (miniumum area and associated minimum residual depth) are defined in Johnston and Slaney (1996) and based on the bankfull channel width of the stream. Glides were defined as areas of flat bottomed, fast-flowing and non-turbulent (laminar) flow. Riffles included areas of turbulent, fast flowing water usually consisting of shallow moderate-gradient areas with gravel or cobble bed material projecting above the water surface and obvious surface turbulence. Cascades included steeper, stepped “riffles” of bedrock or emergent substrates in channels with gradient greater than ~4%. The water surface is usually very turbulent and frothy and white in appearance. Sites were surveyed using a hip chain to track distance with the following attributes recorded for each habitat unit - gradient, mean water depth, mean wetted width, mean bankfull channel width, mean bankfull depth, pool characteristics (max depth, crest depth, residual depth), pool type (scour pool or impoundment), dominant/subdominant bed material type, large woody debris (total of all pieces &gt;10cm in diameter as well as total number of “functional” pieces broken out into multiple size categories), cover (% by type), disturbance indicators, riparian vegetation type, riparian structural stage, overstream canopy closure and spawning gravel amount/type. A clinometer was used to estimate gradient, channel measurements were taken using a tape measure and water depths measured using a measuring stick. Photographs were taken of representative habitats throughout the surveyed reaches. All field measurements were recorded on Level 1 Habitat Survey Data Form templates (Johnston and Slaney (1996)). GPS waypoints were collected at the beginning and end of all Primary habitat units to allow georeferenceing of field data. 3.3 Stream Discharge Estimates of stream discharge were collected on October 18, 2022 coinciding with fish habitat assessments in Weigert Creek. Data was collected in accordance with the Manual of British Columbia Hydrometric Standards (Resources Information Standards Committee 2018). Measurements were taken at points upstream and dowstream of Highway 43 at both Weigert Creek and Brule Creek using a HACH FH950 flow meter and area-velocity method. The stream was divided into 19-20 evenly distributed sections, free from vegetation, immovable rocks and obstructions with stream depth and velocity within each section were collected using a HACH FH950 flow meter. 3.4 Water Temperature A HOBO Water Temp Pro v2 logger was installed approximately 20m upstream of Highway 43 on Weigert Creek and on Brule Creek immediately below the falls at approximately 3.6km upstream of the Highway 43 culverts. Loggers were installed within a white PVC tube housing to prevent thermal transfer, with perforations on the protective housing to allow water to flow through the tubing. The loggers were anchored to the shoreline with steel cable at a water depth of 60% total depth on June 24, 2023 and pulled on November 17, 2023. Temperature was taken at 30-minute intervals for the entire length of time installed. Unfortunately, high flows with Brule Creek resulted in the dislodging of the logger installed under the falls and the subsequent loss of the logger and all associated data. We defined the start of the growing season as per Coleman and Fausch (2007b) which delineate it as the beginning of the first week that average stream temperatures exceed and remain above 5\\(^\\circ\\)C in the spring and the end of the growing season as the last day of the first week that average stream temperature drops below 4\\(^\\circ\\)C. We specified Monday as the first day of the week and identified the week of the year based on the number of 7 day periods from January 1 plus 1. Celsius degree-days were calculated as the mean daily temperature (ex. 2 days with average temperatures of 7\\(^\\circ\\)C with sum to 14 Celsius degree-days).

Some caution should be applied to the interpretation of this data as the first week of water temperature data collected only consisted of three days worth of data (June 24 - June 26) so there is some potential that temperatures in the days and weeks before were high enough that the growing season could be considered longer. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/weigert_temp.png&quot;) Figure 4.3: Temperature profile for Weigert Creek taken at station located approximately 50m upstream of Highway 43 source(&#39;scripts/tidy_temp.R&#39;) my_caption = &#39;Summary of average water temperature by week for Weigert Creek and average air temperature for Sparwood at climate station ID 1157632.&#39; left_join( w_week, temp_week %&gt;% select(week, ave_temp_h20) ) %&gt;% mutate(week = as.character(week), week = case_when(week == 25 ~ &#39;*25&#39;, T ~ week)) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(scroll = gitbook_on, caption = my_caption, footnote_text = &#39;* the first week of water temperature data collected only consisted of three days worth of data (June 24 - June 26)&#39;) Table 4.2: Summary of average water temperature by week for Weigert Creek and average air temperature for Sparwood at climate station ID 1157632. week day_first day_last ave_temp_air ave_temp_h20 13 2022-04-03 2022-04-03 2.9 – 14 2022-04-04 2022-04-10 1.8 – 15 2022-04-11 2022-04-17 -4.5 – 16 2022-04-18 2022-04-24 3.5 – 17 2022-04-25 2022-05-01 5.2 – 18 2022-05-02 2022-05-08 7.7 – 19 2022-05-09 2022-05-15 5.9 – 20 2022-05-16 2022-05-22 6.5 – 21 2022-05-23 2022-05-29 9.2 – 22 2022-05-30 2022-06-05 10.9 – 23 2022-06-06 2022-06-12 12.0 – 24 2022-06-13 2022-06-19 11.5 – *25 2022-06-20 2022-06-26 12.9 4.8 26 2022-06-27 2022-07-03 15.4 5.2 27 2022-07-04 2022-07-10 14.5 5.4 28 2022-07-11 2022-07-17 18.9 6.4 29 2022-07-18 2022-07-24 17.4 7.0 30 2022-07-25 2022-07-31 21.2 7.2 31 2022-08-01 2022-08-07 18.0 6.7 32 2022-08-08 2022-08-14 20.6 7.1 33 2022-08-15 2022-08-21 19.6 7.1 34 2022-08-22 2022-08-28 15.9 6.9 35 2022-08-29 2022-09-04 17.7 6.9 36 2022-09-05 2022-09-11 12.8 6.1 37 2022-09-12 2022-09-18 11.6 6.0 38 2022-09-19 2022-09-25 8.9 5.3 39 2022-09-26 2022-10-02 12.4 5.7 40 2022-10-03 2022-10-09 10.3 5.1 41 2022-10-10 2022-10-16 7.0 4.3 42 2022-10-17 2022-10-23 4.8 3.7 43 2022-10-24 2022-10-30 4.2 3.2 44 2022-10-31 2022-11-06 -1.2 2.2 45 2022-11-07 2022-11-07 -13.5 0.1 the first week of water temperature data collected only consisted of three days worth of data (June 24 - June 26) 4.1.2 Discharge Discharge was measured upstream and downstream of the crossing on October 18, 2023.

The first site was located at the confluence to the Elk River where Weigert Creek redirects to the south. This section was surveyed for 520m. The stream was very fast flowing in sections. The average channel width was 4.38m, the average wetted width was 3.48m, and the average gradient was 3.1%. There were clumps of large woody debris that added complexity to stream habitat. Total cover was rated as moderate with cobbles dominating the in stream substrate. There were some sections that contained gravels suitable for westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning. Habitat quality was rated as medium. The second site was located at the top of the first site, and was surveyed for 450m. Total cover was rated as moderate. The dominant substrate was cobbles with gravels sub dominant. Hydrometric flow data was taken at the bottom of this site, approximately 550m downstream of the highway (Table 4.3). 4.1.4 Stream Characteristics Upstream The stream was surveyed at six different sites upstream of crossing 197534 (sites shown in Figure 4.1). The bottom of the first site was located immediately upstream of crossing 197534 and was surveyed for 350m. The second site was in reach two and was surveyed for 300m to the ford. This section had a wide channel with fast flow. Many larger fish were caught (&gt;200mm). Some deep pools were present at the time of survey that are suitable for overwintering. The dominant in stream substrate was cobbles, followed by boulders. The third site was located upstream of the ford and was surveyed for 550m. Site four was also in reach two and was surveyed for 350m. This section had good flow with abundant boulders and large woody debris. There were some deep pools and abundant gravels suitable for spawning. The fifth site was in reach four and was surveyed for 330m. The stream was steep at some sections, with measured gradients up to 10.5%. The channel was wide with good flow. There were many deep pools suitable for rearing. Some gravels were present suitable for salmonid spawning. A couple of high cascades and large woody debris jams approximately 1m in height were observed that could impede upstream migration of smaller fish. At site six in reach five, the streambed was dewatered. Surveyors worked their way back to where the water ended and surveyed the dry 300m upstream. The stream channel was frequently confined and there was abundant cover. Overall, wetted habitat upstream of crossing 197534 was ranked as medium to high value for westslope cutthrout trout rearing and spawning with patches of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, and stable debris present. 4.1.5 Fish Sampling Electrofishing was conducted at eight sites with results summarised in Tables 4.4 - 4.7 and Figure 4.4. Habitat details are summarized in Table 4.6. Although westslope cutthrout trout, mountain whitefish, bull trout and brook trout were captured downstream of the Highway, only westslope cutthrout were captured above. Also of note, numerous westslope cuthrout trout were captured downstream and upstream of the crossing with a notable presence of only adult fish upstream of the crossing and also a significant increase in the density of adult fish upstream of the crossing. Interestingly, fish were captured upstream of the highway only within the first two reaches to within 300m upstream of the first ford on the Weigert Creek FSR that is located at an elevation of 1320m approximately 1.5km above Highway 43. Above this location, although significant electrofishing effort was conducted (at a location approximately 3km upstream of the highway within Reach 3 and at a site located approximately 6km upstream of the highway within Reach 4), no fish were captured. my_caption = &#39;Electrofishing site summary for Weigert Creek.&#39; # `r if(gitbook_on){knitr::asis_output(&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;)} else knitr::asis_output(&quot;\\\\pagebreak&quot;)` # A total of `r hab_site %&gt;% filter(str_detect(alias_local_name, &#39;_ef&#39;)) %&gt;% nrow()` sites were electrofished within `r hab_site %&gt;% filter(str_detect(alias_local_name, &#39;_ef&#39;)) %&gt;% distinct(gazetted_name) %&gt;% nrow()` streams. hab_site %&gt;% select(gazetted_name, alias_local_name, reach_number, utm_easting, utm_northing, comments ) %&gt;% # filter out two sites that weren&#39;t electrofished filter(str_detect(alias_local_name, &quot;ef&quot;, negate = FALSE)) %&gt;% filter(str_detect(gazetted_name, &quot;Weigert&quot;)) %&gt;% arrange(alias_local_name) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = my_caption) Table 4.4: Electrofishing site summary for Weigert Creek. gazetted_name alias_local_name reach_number utm_easting utm_northing comments Weigert Creek 197534_ds_ef1 1 650979 5532443 Electrofishing commenced at point where Weigert almost touches Elk River then redirects to the south (approximately 210m upstream of mapped confluence).

Crossing 197533 is located on Busato Road 600m upstream from the confluence with the Elk River and crossing 197559 is located on Highway 43 approximately 725m upstream from the confluence with the Elk River. Both crossings are the responsibility of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Both crossings as well as habitat upstream and downstream was assessed in 2020 by Irvine (2021) with detailed reporting linked here. Two fords (PSCIS 197535 and 197536) were documented 700m and 2km upstream of crossing 197559 respectively. At the highway, Brule Creek is a 5th order stream with watershed characteristics detailed in Table 4.10. Brule Creek is known to contain westslope cutthrout trout, rainbow trout and bull trout downstream of the subject culverts and westslope cutthrout trout and rainbow trout above (MoE 2020b). On the south side of the upper watershed, at an elevation of 2000m, is the 5ha Josephine Lake (also known as Big Lake). The lake was stocked with westslope cutthrout trout from 1983 - 2000 (MoE 2020b; “Fish Inventories Data Queries” 2020). PSCIS stream crossings 197533 and 197559 were ranked as high priorities for follow up with new structures designs following habitat confirmations by Irvine (2021) due to the large size of the stream network upstream of the highway. In 2020, the channel was noted as dewatered immediately upstream of Highway 43 with intermittent pools only to a distance approximately 670 m upstream. Assessments in 2022 demonstrated that the culvert on Busato Road was in extremely poor condition with deformations of the inlet and extensive corrosion.

The first site was located approximately 1km upstream from the culvert. This section was surveyed for 600m. The average channel width was 6.0m, the average wetted width was 3.5m, and the average gradient was 2.8%. The dominant streambed substrate was cobbles, with gravels sub-dominant. Total cover from overhanging vegetation and large woody debris was abundant. The habitat quality was rated as medium with moderate value for bull trout and westslope cutthrout trout and pockets of spawning gravels suitable for resident salmonids. The second site electrofished on Brule Creek was located approximately 3.2km upstream of Highway 43. This section was surveyed for 310m to the location of a waterfall shown in Figure 4.17. This waterfall was approximately 7m in height, and blocks upstream migration for all species and life stages potentially present. At the time of survey, the average channel width was 7.5m, the average wetted width was 4.9m, and the average gradient was 2.1%. The dominant substrate was cobbles with boulders sub dominant. The habitat quality was considered moderate with abundant gravels suitable for resident and fluvial westslope cutthroat and bull trout spawning but few pools present that would be suitable for overwintering. Monitoring of the stream immediately upstream of Highway 43 was conducted throughout 2022 to give an indication for the amount of time that dewatering occurs at this location. In 2022, dewatering was noted within the first approximately 400m from May 5th to October 15th. Upstream of the first 400m the stream was noted as flowing year round. tab_hab_summary %&gt;% filter(Site %like% my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of habitat details for electrofishing sites upstream of PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39; on Brule Creek.&#39;), scroll = F) Table 4.12: Summary of habitat details for electrofishing sites upstream of PSCIS crossing 197559 on Brule Creek.

Above this location, although significant electrofishing effort was conducted at a location approximately 2.5km upstream of the highway within Reach 3 and at a site located approximately 6km upstream of the highway within Reach 4, no fish were captured. In the fall of 2022 the entire channel width within Reach 5 was dewatered at a location approximately 8km upstream of Highway 43. Although physical habitat characteristics (pool depths, presence of gravels/LWD, etc) appeared suitable to support westslope cutthrout trout in Reach 3 approximately 5km upstream of Highway 43 and in fact had more complexity than lower reaches due to large woody debris abundance and percent composition of pools, there were no fish captured in the area sampled. This was not expected, as the entire section of stream between where was sampled in Reach 3 and where fish were captured in Reach 2 was surveyed and although some smaller large woody debris jams from 60 - 70cm were observed, no permanent barriers were present that we would expect to block upstream migration of adult westslope cutthrout trout. Cold water temperatures have been demonstrated to provide recruitment bottlenecks in early life stages of westslope cutthrout trout with days during the growing season above an average of 5\\(^\\circ\\)C a key determinant in growth and subsequent fry survival during overwintering (Coleman and Fausch 2007a, 2007b). Furthermore, ongoing programs of temperature modelling for Teck in the region are revealing that the single best predictor variable of westslope cutthrout trout density is temperature (pers. comm. Joe Thorley, Poisson Consulting Ltd.). Although there is some potential that the lack of fish captured in Reach 3 could be related to the potentially hindered upstream migration at the highway culverts, temperature information taken within Reach 1 at approximately 20m upstream of Highway 43 at an elevation of 1260m demonstrated that temperatures close to 5\\(^\\circ\\)C prevailed at this elevation from May - November 2023 indicating that temperatures at higher elevations in the watershed (ie. Reach 3 begins at 1460m) may preclude fish use of these areas. Research detailed in Coleman and Fausch (2007b) indicates that for translocations of greenback cutthroat trout and Colorado River cutthroat trout in north-central Colorado headwater streams - streams that provide 800–900 degree-days probably sustain recruitment in some years, and report that streams with less than 800 degree-days are generally unsuitable for translocations because of the smaller sizes attained by fry before the onset of winter and the associated greater risk of recruitment failure. Average weekly water temperatures in Weigert Creek were at or above 7\\(^\\circ\\)C for only four of the 16 week growing season when the temperature logger was present in the stream with a grand total of 693.5 Celsius degree-days estimated from the dataset. Some caution should be applied to the interpretation of this data (because the first week of data collected fell under the average weekly water temperature threshold of 5\\(^\\circ\\)C and only consisted of three days worth of data - June 24 through June 26) so there is some potential that temperatures in the days and weeks before were high enough that the growing season could be considered longer. However, although subject to change during the drafting of this report (due to ongoing research), at this point in time it seems very conservative to assume that water temperatures were not likely above an average weekly temperature of 5\\(^\\circ\\)C for more than 5 weeks before temperature logging began. If it is assumed that average temperature was at 5.0\\(^\\circ\\)C during those 5 extra weeks, the Celsius degree-days would sum to 808.5 which is just barely in the range of probable for sustaining recruitment even at this low elevation in the watershed. Therefore, cold temperatures during the growing season at locations near the Highway where only adult fish were captured could be an indication that only adult fish are able to survive year to year in these locations as the 570 to 600 Celsius degree days required for fry emergence would leave little time for growth in the system. This leads us to wonder if fry in these cold systems have evolved to migrate downstream upon emergence seeking warmer rearing temperatures in the first years of life. Although more data is necessary to derive conclusions, this train of thought builds the case that improved passage at the Highway could result in more fish in the areas immediately upstream of the highway as 2+ and 3+ fish may wish to populate these areas if they could access them and currently it seems unlikely that small fish could do so. Although difficult to determine cause, presence of only adult fish upstream of the Highway 43 crossing on Weigert Creek and a significant increase in the density of adult fish upstream when compared to downstream could be related to swim speed ability and the associated increased potential for larger fish to migrate from downstream to upstream of the culvert. The fact that fish of the size captured (up to over 30cm long) were within this system so late in the year indicates that they were resident and not merely in the system to spawn. This is particularly interesting as we would not have expected fish of this size to be resident within a system of this relatively small size (average channel width in Reach 2 of 5.5m). Recommendations going forward include: Acquisition of a lidar generated digital elevation model for the a 500m x 500m square area centred over the culvert at Highway 43. This data can provide insight into historic alignment of the floodplain and past realignments of the stream due to road infrastructure. This information can also be extremely valuable for informing future works including not only infrastructure upgrades but restorative actions to increase watershed health. To understand current patterns of movement within the stream, conduct electrofishing within currently fish bearing reaches both upstream and downstream of the crossing, pit tag all captured fish (&gt;50mm long) and resample in future years. As there are extensive tagging programs throughout the Elk River watershed including tagging programs conducted by Nupqu as well as numerous guiding companies, this could give an idea of fish movement not only within Weigert Creek but also allow confirmation of habitat use within the mainstem of the Elk River by fish tagged in Weigert Creek as well as of utilization of habitat in Weigert Creek by fish originally tagged in the Elk River. Collect Weigert Creek temperature data at points known to support westslope cutthrout trout (ie. immediately upstream of the highway and adjacent to the first ford located approximately 1.5km upstream of Highway 43) as well as at areas further upstream (Reach 3 and Reach 4). Coordinate with other programs in the watershed to help determine the best locations for loggers, best timing from installation, contribute data to regional databases and leverage/improve temperature modelling in the region. Attempt to predict temperature for the weeks prior to the date that the temperature logger was installed based on modelling aided by data from other water temperatures in area as well as air temperature data taken at these times. To quantify habitat quality further up in the watershed collect more detailed fish habitat information in Reach 3 and Reach 4. To build an understanding of spawning cutthrout use and timing within the system conduct redd surveys in the spring/summer. To quantify flow characteristics and help build an understanding of how discharge and spawning timing relate to access through the highway crossing, build a stage discharge curve for the watershed and measure flow speeds through the culverts at varying stream discharge rates. 5.2 Brule Creek - PSCIS crossings 197533 and 197559 The waterfall located upstream from Highway 43 limits the amount of potential habitat gained by remediation of stream crossing structures on Busato Road and Highway 43 to 3.6km. Although potentially a result of aggredation related to the Highway 43 culverts and road alignment, the seasonal dewatering in the first 300 - 500m of habitat immediately upstream of Highway 43 (May 5 - October 15 in 2023) is not a desirable habitat characteristic with potential implications for fish stranding. However, the presence of numerous mountain whitefish and westslope cutthrout trout holding in outlet pools downstream of both Bosato Road and Highway 43 along with the visual observaton of a fish in a pool upstream of the crossing in 2022 indicate that fish use of the area upstream would likely occur if the culvert barriers are removed. As cold water temperatures could be limiting within stream habitats upstream of the Highway with effects likely increasing in severity with elevation rise, the amount of habitat viable for westslope cutthrout trout may not be any greater (or could in fact be even less) than the 3.6km of habitat present before the falls. Recommendations going forward include: Acquisition of a lidar generated digital elevation model for the a 500m x 500m square area centred over the culvert at Highway 43. This data can provide insight into historic alignment of the floodplain and past realignments of the stream due to road infrastructure. This information can also be extremely valuable for informing future works including not only infrastructure upgrades but restorative actions to increase watershed health. Collection of temperature data at points known to support westslope cutthrout trout (ie. within the outlet pools of Bosato Road and Highway 43 culverts) as well as at areas of potential access (below the falls at 3.6km) if fish passage were to be remediated at the sites. Capture and pit tagging of fish holding in the pools below Highway 43 and transplanting to underneath the falls at 3.6km. Following one or two growing seasons, attempts could be made to recapture these fish from the vicinity of where they have been transplanted. This would provide valuable insight into fish movement as well as the ability of upstream habitats to support westsloope cutthrout rearing and overwintering. Remove the severely damaged Busato Road crossing and restore riparian areas between the two roads to a more functional state would be a cost effective solution to resolve passage into and increase the value of the 125m of habitat located between the two crossings. Vehicular access to all areas adjacent to Busato Road would not be significantly impacted by removal of the culvert as traffic can access either end of Busato Road from Highway 43. A stepped approach to restoration on this stream would provide opportunities to understand fish movement and habitat suitability through pit tagging and recapture of fish relocated from areas of construction site salvage to upstream of the Highway as well as downstream of Busato Road. At the time of 2022 surveys, riparian areas between the two roads were heavily degraded and fish passage remediation works at Busato Road would provide opportunities for improvement of soils and riparian vegetation that would have benefits for downstream populations. In addition, restoration of this first piece of stream would help build momentum for works upstream and build awareness for riparian health issues related to range use of the land adjacent to the stream present on private lands both upstream of Highway 43 and downstream of Busato Road. Quantify habitat quality in the watershed by collecting detailed fish habitat information between the confluence with the Elk River and the falls at 3.6km.
