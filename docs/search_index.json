"],["intro.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction New Graph Environment Ltd. was retained by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in the summer of 2022 to conduct effectivness monitoring at three sites in northern BC. Subject streams included Cross Creek in the and Weigert Creek. New Graph Environment Ltd. was sub-contracted by Nupqu to assist with project delivery. The health and viability of freshwater fish populations can depend on access to tributary and off channel areas which provide refuge during high flows, opportunities for foraging, overwintering habitat, spawning habitat and summer rearing habitat (Bramblett et al. 2002; Swales and Levings 1989; Diebel et al. 2015). Culverts can present barriers to fish migration due to low water depth, increased water velocity, turbulence, a vertical drop at the culvert outlet and/or maintenance issues (Slaney, Zaldokas, and Watershed Restoration Program (B.C.) 1997; Cote et al. 2005). As the costs and effort required for works to remediate fish passage issues through the replacement of road/stream crossings can be significant, acquisition of detailed habitat, fish sampling, water temperature and discharge data is a prudent measure to help ensure there is a reasonable understanding of current conditions, including species composition/density upstream and downstream of the crossings as well as the value and suitability of associated habitats for target fish species (westslope cutthrout trout) before investments in infrastructure to improve connectivity are made. This work helps build our understanding of the extent of the issues present that may be a result of subject culverts as well as providing baseline data for assessing the benefits of remedial work post-fish passage remediation. "],["background.html", "2 Background", " 2 Background Study areas for 2022 field work included Cross Creek on the west shore of Babine Lake in the Babine Lake Watershed Group, Bittner Creek, within the Prince George city limits in the Tabor River watershed group and Five Mile Creek located approximately 11km east of the town of Williams Lake within the San Jose River watershed group. Road stream crossing structures at the three locations have been replaced in the last 10 years. The intention of the work was to provide information regarding the effectiveness of structure replacements in regards to facilitating upstream fish migration as well as to describe habitat conditions related to work areas potentially impacted by structure replacement works. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/overview_mot_2022.png&quot;) Figure 2.1: Map of monitoring site locations. "],["methods.html", "3 Methods 3.1 Fish Passage Assessments 3.2 Habitat Assessments 3.3 Reporting", " 3 Methods 3.1 Fish Passage Assessments In the field, crossings prioritized for follow-up were first assessed for fish passage following the procedures outlined in “Field Assessment for Determining Fish Passage Status of Closed Bottomed Structures” (MoE 2011a). Crossings surveyed included closed bottom structures (CBS), open bottom structures (OBS) and crossings considered “other” (i.e. fords). Photos were taken at surveyed crossings and when possible included images of the road, crossing inlet, crossing outlet, crossing barrel, channel downstream and channel upstream of the crossing and any other relevant features. The following information was recorded for all surveyed crossings: date of inspection, crossing reference, crew member initials, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, stream name, road name and kilometer, road tenure information, crossing type, crossing subtype, culvert diameter or span for OBS, culvert length or width for OBS. A more detailed “full assessment” was completed for all closed bottom structures and included the following parameters: presence/absence of continuous culvert embedment (yes/no), average depth of embedment, whether or not the culvert bed resembled the native stream bed, presence of and percentage backwatering, fill depth, outlet drop, outlet pool depth, inlet drop, culvert slope, average downstream channel width, stream slope, presence/absence of beaver activity, presence/absence of fish at time of survey, type of valley fill, and a habitat value rating. Habitat value ratings were based on channel morphology, flow characteristics (perennial, intermittent, ephemeral), fish migration patterns, the presence/absence of deep pools, un-embedded boulders, substrate, woody debris, undercut banks, aquatic vegetation and overhanging riparian vegetation (Table 3.1). For crossings determined to be potential barriers or barriers based on the data (see Barrier Scoring), a culvert fix and recommended diameter/span was proposed. fpr::fpr_table_habvalue %&gt;% knitr::kable(caption = &#39;Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011).&#39;, booktabs = T) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1, width_min = &#39;1.5in&#39;) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_styling(c(&quot;condensed&quot;), full_width = T, font_size = font_set) Table 3.1: Habitat value criteria (Fish Passage Technical Working Group, 2011). Habitat Value Fish Habitat Criteria High The presence of high value spawning or rearing habitat (e.g., locations with abundance of suitably sized gravels, deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris) which are critical to the fish population. Medium Important migration corridor. Presence of suitable spawning habitat. Habitat with moderate rearing potential for the fish species present. Low No suitable spawning habitat, and habitat with low rearing potential (e.g., locations without deep pools, undercut banks, or stable debris, and with little or no suitably sized spawning gravels for the fish species present). 3.1.1 Barrier Scoring Fish passage potential was determined for each stream crossing identified as a closed bottom structure as per MoE (2011a). The combined scores from five criteria: depth and degree to which the structure is embedded, outlet drop, stream width ratio, culvert slope, and culvert length were used to screen whether each culvert was a likely barrier to some fish species and life stages (Table 3.2, Table 3.3. These criteria were developed based on data obtained from various studies and reflect an estimation for the passage of a juvenile salmon or small resident rainbow trout (Clarkin et al. 2005 ; Bell 1991; Thompson 2013). tab &lt;- as_tibble(t(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% mutate(V4 = names(fpr_table_barrier_scoring)) %&gt;% select(V4, everything()) %&gt;% janitor::row_to_names(1) %&gt;% ##turn the table sideways mutate(Risk = case_when(Risk == &#39;Value&#39; ~ &#39; Value&#39;, T ~ Risk)) tab %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = &#39;Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).&#39;, scroll = F) Table 3.2: Fish Barrier Risk Assessment (MoE 2011).

A key goal of the assessments was to gather stream width information upstream and downstream of the stream crossing structures to provide information regarding stream channel constriction through road/stream crossing structures as this can hinder upstream fish migration. To standardize data collected and facilitate submission of the data to provincial databases, information was collected on “Site Cards”. Additional habitat characteristics recorded included channel widths, wetted widths, residual pool depths, gradients, bankfull depths, stage, temperature, conductivity, pH, cover by type, substrate and channel morphology (among others). When possible, the crew surveyed downstream of the crossing to the point where fish presence had been previously confirmed and upstream to a minimum distance of 600m. Any potential obstacles to fish passage were inventoried with photos, physical descriptions and locations recorded on site cards. Surveyed routes were recorded with time-signatures on handheld GPS units. 3.3 Reporting Reporting was generated with bookdown (Xie 2016) from Rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2023) with primarily R (rcoreteam2022languageenvironment?) and SQL scripts. The R package fpr contains many specialized custom functions related to the work (irvine2023NewGraphEnvironmentfpr?).

Channel is watered all the way through at this point Channel flowing at bankfull channel width due to heavy rain in previous days. Velocity Similar to downstream and upstream at the time of survey as very little flow was present. Similar to downstream and upstream although there are not defined stoneline riffle breaks yet. Estimated to be slightly higher than upstream and downstream. Although pipe diameter is generally equivalent to average channel width more substrate within pipe structure would increase roughness and slow flows. Constriction Channel width under bridge was measured as an average of 4.6m between the riprap. Downstream average channel width was 8.2m and upstream was 6.4m. Culvert does not constrict channel. Diameter of pipe is equivalent to the average of the upstream and downstream channel widths. Substrate Substrate equivalent to upstream and downstream and consists of primarily gravels and small cobbles. Substrate equivalent to upstream and downstream and consists of primarily gravels and small cobbles. As the stream was turbed it was difficult to determine a subdominant substrate but by using a pole it appeared as though it was fines mixed in with boulders. Substrate within pipe was large cobbles. Riparian Downstream area adjacent to the bridge was lacking meaningful riparian vegetation due to a likely lack of shrub/tree installation during construction and the size of the channel in this location due to historic massive outlet pool. Cuttings were installed on the upstream downstream sides of the gabion basket walls as well as immediately adjacent to the culvert. They appear to be growing at this point but year two and three will provide better indicators of survival/cover. Riparian appears to have impacted by recent wildfire with widely spaced conifers dead. Vegetation within area of construction dominated by agronomic grasses. Upstream of construction area dominated by natural shrubs. Uav Flight no yes no Flow Depth Flow depths are shallow downstream of bridge where large deposit of gravel is located. Wondering if this gravel accumulated over the years when the culvert was in place and potentially restricting flows upstream resulting in deposition of gravels in this area. Channel restoration plan to maintain large outlet pool was not successful likley due to downstream transport of sediments that had accumulated upstream of the crossing. Flow depths range from 4 - 7 cm at outlet and similar upstream. If there was a way to create more complexity in the substrate underneath the crossing there could be better holding areas for fish to move through. However that does not appear to be fish stacked up at the outlet and there are numerous spawning fish upstream. Flow depths at outlet estimated as 30cm - similar to upstream. Stability Crossing stable. Crossing stable. Crossing stable. Revegetation Revegetation appears reasonable. Future opportunities could be explored for riparian restoration on the river right bank where agricultural field is directly adjacent to the creek. More riparian plantings could have been placed upstream on the left and right banks as there is notable erosion there. Natural recruitment a cottonwood may provide stability and long-term cover. Numerous invasive weeds present includeing mullen and Canada Thistle. Vegetation within area of construction dominated by agronomic grasses. Upstream of construction area riparian is dominated by natural shrubs. Silt fencing should be removed from site. Cover There does not appear to be any habitat enhancements creating cover in the vicinity of the bridge. Reports related to project planning indicate that the historic outlet pool was meant to provide cover however this area has infilled with gravels. Large woody debris is placed upstream of the crossing however they are small links of wood from half a metre to 3 m long and will not likely remain in the channel. Some boulders were placed upstream which will likely provide habitat complexity in the long term. overhanging vegetation and large woody debrid minimal within construction footprint. Maintenance No maintenance issues. The wetted channel is extremely small immediately downstream of the bridge where gravels have accumulated. This may be causing connectivity issues during dry times of year however perhaps this is part of typical dewatering in this system. No maintenance issues noted. No maintenance issues noted. 4.1 Bittner Creek - PSCIS crossing 196200 my_site &lt;- 196200 PSCIS crossing 196200 on Bittner Creek is located on Foreman Road within the municiple boundaries of the City of Prince George approximately 0.7km upstream from the confluence with the Fraser River (Figure 4.1). In 2016, just downstream of the subject crossing, the banks of Bittner Creek were armoured to stabilize two areas of erosion. To compensate for the net negative habitat balance of the project, the replacement of the culvert on Bittner Creek was included as a habitat enhancement in the habitat offsetting plan associated with permitting of the work. At crossing 196200, Bittner Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 40.1km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 768m to 574m at the crossing (Table 4.3). The subject site is the first stream crossing structure upstream of the Fraser River with numerous modelled and previously assessed stream crossing structures upstream. Upstream of the site approximately 400m there is a crossing modelled (modelled_crossing_id 19703286) on the Canadian National railway line. Although data related to the assessment of this crossing was not provided and has not been uploaded to the Provincial Stream Crossing Inventory Summary System (PSCIS), DWB Consulting Services Ltd. (2019) report that the “CN crossing is considered passable to fish”. knitr::include_graphics(&quot;fig/lidar_bittner_fig.png&quot;) Figure 4.1: Lidar generated digital elevation model of Bittner Creek at Foreman Road. fpr::fpr_table_wshd_sum(site_id = my_site) %&gt;% fpr::fpr_kable(caption_text = paste0(&#39;Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing &#39;, my_site, &#39;.&#39;), footnote_text = &#39;Elev P60 = Elevation at which 60% of the watershed area is above&#39;, scroll = F) Table 4.3: Summary of derived upstream watershed statistics for PSCIS crossing 196200.

Adjacent landowner mentioned that in 30 years he has not seen salmon come to spawn and also indicated that the stream dewaters annually. 4.1.2 Stream Characteristics Habitat characteristics were gathered upstream and downstream of the Foreman Road bridge over Bittner Creek (Figure 4.1 and Table 4.5. Flows at the time of the survey were low with near dewatering throughout sections of stream surveyed both upstream and downstream. Water temperature was 15\\(^\\circ\\)C, pH was 8.1 and conductivity was 432uS/cm. The landowner adjacent to the bridge (north-east side) was consulted to let them know that surveyors would be within the stream channel adjacent to their property. They reported that the stream dewatered completely on an annual basis and that they were not aware of use of the stream by Fraser River salmon.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure worked together with Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Canadian Wildlife Federation to plan and implement replacement of the existing culverts with an open bottomed geotextile soil arched reinforced structure designed by Terratech Consulting Ltd in the summer of 2021. A short video documents the story here. An impassible 9m falls is located on the mainstem of the stream approximately 1km upstream of Babine Lake Road (FINS Consulting Ltd. 2000; MoE 2023b). There are no other stream crossings modelled between the road and the falls. Upstream of the crossing lake chub, coho salmon, rainbow trout, kokanee, and sockeye salmon have been recorded (MoE 2023a; Norris [2018] 2023).

The crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream migration according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b). Photos taken in 2017 - before the remediation was completed are included as Figure 4.9. In 2022, the site was reassessed. As PSCIS crossing 198283 was a newly installed open bottomed structure it ranked as a passable to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table 4.8). Surveys were conducted with a remotely piloted aircraft upstream of the crossing with resulting images stitched into an orthomosaic and 3-dimensional model presented in Figures 4.10 - 4.11.

The structure is located within the boundaries of the Williams Lake 1 First Nation Reservation. The area around Five Mile Creek is home to T’exelcemc people of the T’exelc First Nation. The T’exelc First Nation (also known as the Williams Lake Indian Band) is part of the larger Secwepemc (Shuswap) Nation with traditional territory covering a vast area of central British Columbia. Secwepemctsin is the language of the Secwepem. It contains the cultural, ecological, and historical knowledge connecting the land and the people (T’exelcemc 2023; First Peoples’ Cultural Council 2023). The Five Mile Creek watershed upstream of the Highway encompasses three other First Nations reserve areas including Five Mile 3, James Louis 3A and Carpenter Mountain 15. Replacement of the historic structure (900mm round culvert) in 2016 was necessary to four-laning Highway 97. Five Mile Creek flows into Borland Creek approximately 800m downstream of the highway then into the San Jose River a further 2.1km downstream. The San Jose River in turn empties into Williams Lake approximately 4.5km downstream of the highway. Although apparently a rare occurrence, due to impacts to Williams Creek which drains Williams Lake, there are reports of sockeye salmon ascending from the Fraser River to Williams Lake and in theory spawning in the San Jose River. It is thought that these fish are from the Quesnel stock (williamslaketribune2022?). On Five Mile Creek Between the highway and the San Jose River there are two previously unassessed crossings modelled as closed bottom structures. The first (modelled_crossing_id 17500597) is modelled as 300m downstream and the second (modelled_crossing_id 17500595) is modelled as located approximately 1km downstream. At crossing 198400, Five Mile Creek is a fourth order stream with a watershed area upstream of the crossing of approximately 63.1km2. The elevation of the watershed ranges from a maximum of 1061m to NAm at the crossing (Table 4.10). Upstream of the crossing sucker (general), longnose sucker, white sucker, largescale sucker, chub (general), peamouth chub, northern pikeminnow, longnose dace, leopard dace, redside shiner, burbot, lake whitefish, all pacific salmon, pink salmon, coho salmon, rainbow trout, kokanee, sockeye salmon, brook trout, and lake trout have been recorded (MoE 2023a; Norris [2018] 2023). Numerous lakes and wetlands are located in the Five Mile Creek watershed including Dugan Lake (96ha), Goldpan Lake (41ha) and Cariboo Bill Lake (30ha).

Although the site was not The crossing ranked as a barrier to upstream migration according to the provincial protocol (MoE 2011b). Photos taken in 2017 - before the remediation was completed are included as Figure 4.9. In 2022, the site was reassessed. As PSCIS crossing 198400 was a newly installed open bottomed structure it ranked as a to upstream fish passage according to the provincial protocol (Table 4.8). 4.3.2 Stream Characteristics (Figure 4.16 and Table ??.
